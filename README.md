# Similarity-Model-for-Visual-Analysis-of-Scatterplots

Abstract: This project is based on the paper “ScatterNet: A Deep Subjective Similarity Model for Visual Analysis of Scatterplots”. It applies the technique from this paper to collect datasets of similar and dissimilar images and do the classification to create similarity models and try to use neural network to train a classifier. It aims to compare the effectiveness of human visual perception and neural network feature extraction. This project described two scenarios to compare the similarity between images.

Description: test2.py file is used to translate csv files to json format files. train.py file is used to calculate Cosine distance. I uploaded a classes.zip becasue these are all images in different classes. And I moved some images to different root to do the similarity computation. And I uploaded those images separately as you can see. For convenience, I uploaded plot.zip. You can see different data files in this folder and plot.html is used to display images. To translate csv files, you need to import pandas. To calculate the distance, you need to import numpy, tensorflow, opencv, spicy.spacial libraries. I didn't upload those origianl csv files because they are too large and it's unnecessary.
