# Similarity-Model-for-Visual-Analysis-of-Scatterplots
This project is based on the paper “ScatterNet: A Deep Subjective Similarity Model for Visual Analysis of Scatterplots”. It applies the technique from this paper to collect datasets of similar and dissimilar images and do the classification to create similarity models and try to use neural network to train a classifier
