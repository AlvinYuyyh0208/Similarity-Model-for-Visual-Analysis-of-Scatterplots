# Similarity-Model-for-Visual-Analysis-of-Scatterplots
Abstract: This project is based on the paper “ScatterNet: A Deep Subjective Similarity Model for Visual Analysis of Scatterplots”. It applies the technique from this paper to collect datasets of similar and dissimilar images and do the classification to create similarity models and try to use neural network to train a classifier. It aims to compare the effectiveness of human visual perception and neural network feature extraction. This project described two scenarios to compare the similarity between images.
